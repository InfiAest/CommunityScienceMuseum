                <h1>Exhibition Spaces</h1>
                <p>We have a number of exhibition spaces that we change up every now and then.</p>
                <p>You can use the quick links on the right to jump to a particular exhibition or 
                    you can scroll down to browse all our current exhibitions and get excited to 
                    come down to see them in person.</p>
                <h2>Cosmology</h2>
                <div class="cosmology-img"></div>
                <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, 
                    explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us.</p>
                <p>We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a 
                    bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.</p>
                <p>Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s 
                    telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.</p>
                <h2>Evolution</h2>
                <div class="evolution-img"></div>
                <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our 
                    origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his 
                    theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our 
                    place in this world.</p>
                <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have 
                    evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who 
                    didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>
                <h2>Biology & Medicine</h2>
                <div class="biology-img"></div>
                <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering 
                    us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world. </p>
                <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much 
                    improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of 
                    exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs 
                    including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant. </p>
                <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from 
                    observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>
                <h2>Robotics & AI</h2>
                <div class="robotics-img"></div>
                <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the 
                    science of the future. From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, 
                    the future is here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.</p>
                <h2>Ecology</h2>
                <div class="ecology-img"></div>
                <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more 
                    important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not 
                    just for humans but for the whole planet.</p>
                <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including 
                    global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive 
                    ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.</p>
